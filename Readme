This is a Python script utilizing the Streamlit library to create a web application called "RecipeGem." Let's break down the script step by step:

### 1. Imports:
- `streamlit`: A Python library for building interactive web applications.
- `Image` from `PIL`: A module from the Python Imaging Library (PIL) used for opening, manipulating, and saving many different image file formats.
- `google.generativeai`: This seems to be a custom module for accessing Google's Generative AI models.

### 2. Configuration:
- `genai.configure(api_key="YOUR_API_KEY")`: This line configures the Google Generative AI module with an API key for authentication.

### 3. Function Definitions:
- `get_gemini_response`: This function takes input text, an image, and a prompt as parameters. It then generates a response using the Gemini Pro Vision model from the Google Generative AI API based on the provided inputs.
- `input_image_details`: This function processes an uploaded image file and returns its details as bytes data.

### 4. Page Configuration and Custom CSS:
- `st.set_page_config`: Sets the configuration of the Streamlit page, including the title.
- Custom CSS: Defines some CSS styles for styling the elements of the web application.

### 5. UI Components:
- `st.header`: Displays the main header of the application.
- `st.file_uploader`: Component for uploading image files.
- `st.text_input`: Component for receiving text input from the user.
- `st.button`: Component for creating a button.
- `st.image`: Displays the uploaded image.
- `st.subheader`: Displays a subheader for the response.
- `st.write`: Writes the response generated by the Gemini Pro Vision model.

### 6. Main Logic:
- The script first allows the user to upload an image or type ingredients.
- When the user clicks the "Generate Recipe" button, it checks if an image or text input is provided. If not, it displays an error message.
- If inputs are provided, it calls the `get_gemini_response` function to generate a recipe based on the uploaded image and/or typed ingredients and displays the response.

### 7. Prompt for Gemini Model:
- `input_prompt`: Provides a prompt for the Gemini Pro Vision model. It explains to the model what type of task it needs to perform based on the uploaded image and/or typed ingredients.

### Summary:
Overall, this script creates a simple web application that takes either an uploaded image or typed ingredients, processes them using Google's Generative AI model, and generates a recipe based on the provided inputs. The application is built using Streamlit for the user interface and utilizes Google's Generative AI API for generating the recipe.
